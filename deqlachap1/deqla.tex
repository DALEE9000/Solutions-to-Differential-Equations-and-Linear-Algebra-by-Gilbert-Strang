% QUESTION 1
\qs{1.1.1}{Draw the graph of \(y = e^{t}\) by hand, for \(-1 \le t \le 1\). What is its slope \(dy / dt\) at \(t = 0\)? Add the straight line graph of \(y = et\). Where do those two graphs cross?}

At \(t=0\), \(dy / dt = e^{0} = 1\). The functions \(y = e^{t}\) and \(y = et\) meet at \(\!\left( 1, e \right) \).

\qs{1.1.2}{Draw the graph of \(y_{1} = e^{2t}\) on top of \(y_{2} = 2 e^{t}\). Which function is larger at \(t=0\)? Which function is larger at \(t=1\)?}

At \(t=0\), \(y_{2} > y_{1}\). At \(t=1\), \(y_{1} > y_{2}\).

% QUESTION 3
\qs{1.1.3}{What is the slope of \(y=e^{-t}\) at \(t=0\)? Find the slope \(dy/dt\) at \(t=1\).}

Calculate \(dy/dt = -e^{-t}\). Then 
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d y}{d t}_{\!\left( t=0 \right) } &= -e^{0} = -1 \\
	\frac{d y}{d t}_{\!\left( t=1 \right) } &= -e^{-1}
\end{align*}

% QUESTION 4
\qs{1.1.4}{What "logarithm" do we use for the number \(t\) (the exponent) when \(e^{t} = 4\)?}

The natural logarithm: \(\ln\!\left( e^{t} \right) = \ln\!\left( 4 \right)\) implies \(t = \ln\!\left( 4 \right)\).

\vspace{12pt}

% QUESTION 5
\qs{1.1.5}{State the chain rule for the derivative \(dy/dt\) if \(y \!\left( t \right) = f \!\left( u \!\left( t \right)  \right) \) (chain of \(f\) and \(u\)).}
\[
	\frac{d }{d t} y \!\left( t \right) = \frac{d f}{d u}_{\!\left( u \!\left( t \right)  \right)} \cdot \frac{d u}{d t}  
\]

% QUESTION 6
\qs{1.1.6}{The \textit{second} derivative of \(e^{t}\) is again \(e^{t}\). So \(y=e^{t}\) solves \(d^{2}y/dt^{2} = y\). A second order differential equation should have another solution, different from \(y=Ce^{t}\). What is that second solution?}

Since \(y = e^{-t}\) has second derivative \(d^{2}y/dt^{2} = e^{-t}\), we must have as our second solution \(y = De^{-t}\).

\vspace{12pt}

% QUESTION 7
\qs{1.1.7}{Show that the nonlinear example \(dy/dt = y^{2}\) is solved by \(y = C / \!\left( 1 - Ct \right) \) for every constant \(C\). The choice \(C = 1\) gave \(y = 1 / \!\left( 1-t \right) \), starting from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\).}
For \(y = C / \!\left( 1 - Ct \right) \), we have
\[
	\frac{d y}{d t} = - \!\left( \frac{1}{1-Ct} \right)^{2}  C	 \!\left( -C \right) = \!\left( \frac{C}{1-Ct} \right)^{2} = y^{2}
\]	

% QUESTION 8
\qs{1.1.8}{Why will the solution to \(dy/dt = y^{2}\) grow faster than the solution to \(dy/dt = y\) (if we start them both from \(y=1\) at \(t=0\))? The first solution blows up at \(t=1\). The second solution \(e^{t}\) grows exponentially fast but it never blows up.}

Observe that
\[
	\lim\limits_{t^{-} \to 1} \frac{1}{1-t} = +\infty
\]
Hence the first solution grows considerably faster than the second solution as \(t\) approaches \(1\).

\qs{1.1.9}{Find a solution to \(dy/dt = -y^{2}\) starting from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\). Integrate \(dy/y^{2}\) and \(-dt\). (Or work with \(z = 1/y\). Then \(\bm{dz/dt} = \!\left( dz/dy \right) \!\left( dy/dt \right) = \!\left( -1/y^{2} \right) \!\left( -y^{2} \right) = \textbf{1}\). From \(dz/dt = 1\) you will know \(z \!\left( t \right) \) and \(y = 1/z\).}

\underline{Solution 1.} Write
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	&-\int \frac{1}{y^{2}} \ dy  && = \int  \ dt  \\
	&\implies y^{-1} && = t + C \\ 
	&\implies y && = \boxed{\frac{1}{t + C}, \quad C = 1}
\end{alignat*}

\underline{Solution 2.} Let \(z = 1/y\). Then
\[
	\frac{d z}{d t} = \frac{d z}{d y} \frac{d y}{d t} = \!\left( -\frac{1}{y^{2}} \right) \!\left( -y^{2} \right) = 1
\]
Since \(dz/dt = 1\),
\begin{align*}
	\int \ dz = \int \ dt & \implies z = t + C \\
	 & \implies \frac{1}{y} = t + C \\ 
	 & \implies \boxed{y = \frac{1}{t + C}, \quad C = 1}
\end{align*}

% QUESTION 10
\qs{1.1.10}{Which of these differential equations are linear (in \(y\))?\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \(y' + \sin y = t\)
	\item \(y' = t^{2} \!\left( y-t \right) \)
	\item \(y' + e^{t}y = t^{10}\)
\end{enumerate}}

Only (b) and (c) are linear in \(y\).

\vspace{12pt}

% QUESTION 11
\qs{1.1.11}{The product rule gives what derivative for \(e^{t} e^{-t}\)? This function is constant. At \(t=0\) this constant is \(1\). Then \(e^{t}e^{-t} = 1\) for all \(t\).}

By the product rule, we have
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d }{d t} \!\left( e^{t}e^{-t} \right)  & = e^{-t} \frac{d }{d t} \!\left( e^{t} \right) + e^{t} \frac{d }{d t} \!\left( e^{-t} \right)  \\
	 & = \!\left( e^{-t} \right) \!\left( e^{t} \right) - \!\left( e^{t} \right) \!\left( e^{-t} \right)  \\ 
	 & = 0
\end{align*}

which aligns with the result that \(d(1)/dt = 0\).

% QUESTION 12
\qs{1.1.12}{\(dy/dt = y + 1\) is not solved by \(y = e^{t} + t\). Substitute that \(y\) to show it fails. We can't just add the solutions to \(y' = y\) and \(y' = 1\). What number \(c\) makes \(y = e^{t} + c\) into a correct solution?}

Observe that
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d }{d t} \!\left( e^{t} + t \right)   & = e^{t} + 1 \\
	 & \neq e^{t} + t + 1 \\ 
\end{align*}

If \(c = -1\), we have
\begin{align*}

% QUESTION 1
\qs{1.3.1}{Set \(t = 2\) in the infinite series for \(e^{2}\). The sum must be \(e\) times \(e\), close to \(7.39\). How many terms in the series to reach a sum of \(7\)? How many terms to pass \(7.3\)?}

Five terms are needed to reach 7 exactly:
\[
	y = 1 + t + \frac{1}{2!}t^{2} + \frac{1}{3!}t^{3} + \frac{1}{4!}t^{4} = 7
\]
And seven terms to surpass 7.3:
\[
	y = 1 + t + \frac{1}{2!}t^{2} + \frac{1}{3!}t^{3} + \frac{1}{4!}t^{4} + \frac{1}{5!}t^{5} + \frac{1}{6!}t^{6} \approx 7.36
\]

\begin{python}
t = 2

term2 = 1 + t

% QUESTION 2
\qs{1.3.2}{Starting from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\), find the solution to \(dy/dt = y\) at time \(t = 1\). Starting from that \(y \!\left( 1 \right) \), solve \(dy/dt = -y\) to time \(t = 2\). Draw a rough graph of \(y \!\left( t \right) \) from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 2\). What does this say about \(e^{-1}\) times \(e\)?}

The solution to \(dy/dt = y\) is \(y = Ce^{t}\); since by premise we have \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\), this implies \(C = 1\). Moreover, we have \(y \!\left( 1 \right) = e\). For \(dy/dt = -y\), we have solution \(y = De^{-t}\). Using \(y \!\left( 1 \right) = e\), we may conclude \(D = e^{2}\). Thus at \(t = 2\), \(y \!\left( 2 \right) = 1\). The complete solution is
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) =
	\begin{cases}
		e^{t} & 0 \le t \le 1 \\
		e^{2-t} & 1 < t \le 2 \\
	\end{cases}
\]
Graphically, we have:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../chap1/sec1.3/chap1sec1.3ex2.eps}

This implies that \(e^{-1} \cdot e = 1\).

% QUESTION 3
\qs{1.3.3}{Start with \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = \$5000\). If this grows by \(dy/dt = .02y\) until \(t = 5\) and then jumps to \(a = .04\) per year until \(t = 10\), what is the account balance at \(t = 10\)?}

The solution to \(dy/dt = .02y\) with \(y_{1} \!\left( 0 \right) = 5000\) is \(y_{1} = 5000e^{.02t}\), for \(0 \le t \le 5\). 

When the interest rate changes to \(.04\) at \(t = 5\), we must solve \(dy/dt = .04y\) and impose the initial constraint that \(y_{2} \!\left( 5 \right) = y_{1} \!\left( 5 \right) \). We can conclude that \(y_{2}\) is
\[
	y_{2} \!\left( t \right) = \!\left( \frac{5000e^{.02 \cdot 5}}{e^{.04 \cdot 5}} \right) e^{.04t} = \!\left( 5000e^{-.1} \right) e^{.04t} , \quad 5 < t \le 10
\]
Lastly, we calculate that at \(t = 10\), \(y \!\left( 10 \right) = \$6749.29\). Graphically, we have

Switching \(.02\) and \(.04\) in the previous problem, we derive the exact same balance of \(y \!\left( 10 \right) = \$6749.29\). The piecewise solutions are
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) =
	\begin{cases}
		y_{1} \!\left( t \right)  = 5000e^{.04t} & 0 \le t \le 5 \\
		y_{2} \!\left( t \right)  = \!\left( \frac{5000e^{.04 \cdot 5}}{e^{.02 \cdot 5}} \right) e^{.02t} & 5 < t \le 10 \\

\qs{1.3.5}{Replace \(t\) by \(at\) in the exponential series to find \(e^{at}\):
\[
	e^{at} = 1 + at + \frac{1}{2} \!\left( at \right)^{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!} \!\left( at \right)^{n} + \cdots

Take the derivative of every term (keep five terms). Factor out \(a\) to show that \textit{the derivative of \(e^{at}\) equals \(ae^{at}\)}. At what time \(T\) does \(e^{at}\) reach 2?}

% QUESTION 6
\qs{1.3.6}{Start from \(y' = ay\). Take the derivative of that equation. Take the \(n^{\text{th}}\) derivative. Construct the Taylor series that matches all these derivatives at \(t = 0\), starting from \(1 + at + \frac{1}{2} \!\left( at \right)^{2}\). Confirm that this series for \(y \!\left( t \right) \) is the series for \(e^{at}\) in Problem 5.}

The derivative of \(y' = ay\) is:
\[
	y'' = ay'
\]
The \(n^{\textit{th}}\) derivative is:
\[
	y^{\!\left( n + 1 \right) } = ay^{\!\left( n \right) }
\]
Starting from \(1 + at + \frac{1}{2} \!\left( at \right)^{2}\), we observe that
\[
	y' = a + a \!\left( at \right) \quad \text{and} \quad ay = a \!\left( 1 + at + \frac{1}{2} \!\left( at \right)^{2} \right) 
\]
but as it stands, the two sides are unequal. If we add a term \(\frac{1}{3!} \!\left( at \right)^{3}\), we have
\[
	y' = a + a \!\left( at \right) + \frac{1}{2} a \!\left( at \right)^{2} \quad \text{and} \quad ay = a \!\left( 1 + at + \frac{1}{2} \!\left( at \right)^{2} + \frac{1}{3!} \!\left( at \right)^{3} \right) 
\]
In fact, we will need to continue adding terms of the form \(\frac{1}{n!} \!\left( at \right)^{n}\) ad infinitem. Observe that we derive the result of Problem 5 in this manner.

In general, the \(k^{\text{th}}\) derivative of the term \(\frac{1}{n!} \!\left( at \right)^{n}\) is
\[
	\frac{1}{\!\left( n-k \right)!} a^{k} \!\left( at \right)^{n-k}
\]
Then the equation \(y^{\!\left( n + 1 \right)} = ay^{\!\left( n \right) }\) is
\[
	a^{n + 1} + a^{n + 1} \!\left( at \right) + \frac{1}{2!} a^{n + 1} \!\left( at \right)^{2} + \cdots = a \!\left( a^{n} + a^{n} \!\left( at \right) + \frac{1}{2!} a^{n} \!\left( at \right)^{2} + \cdots \right)

\par (a) We have \(y \!\left( t \right) = e^{\!\left( \ln 2 \right) t} = 2^{t}\). Then \(y \!\left( 1 \right) = 2\) and \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\). Thus

\qs{1.3.11}{In a one-year investment of \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = \$100\), suppose the interest rate jumps from \(6\%\) to \(10 \%\) after six months. Does the equivalent rate for a whole year equal \(8 \%\), or more than \(8 \%\), or less than \(8 \%\)?}

The initial condition \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = \$100\) implies \(C = 100\) for the solution \(y_{1} \!\left( t \right) = Ce^{.06t}\). To find the initial condition on \(y_{2} \!\left( t \right) = De^{.1t}\), we must have
\[
	y_{1} \!\left( 6 \right) = 100e^{.06 \cdot 6} = y_{2} \!\left( 6 \right) = De^{.1 \cdot 6}
\]
implying that \(D = 100 e^{-.24}\). The piecewise solutions are
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \begin{cases}
		y_{1} \!\left( t \right) = 100e^{.06t}  & 0 \le t \le 6 \\
		y_{2} \!\left( t \right) = \!\left( 100e^{-.24} \right) e^{.1t} & 6 < t \le 12  \\

The solution \(y\) solves \(dy/dt = a \!\left( t \right) y\). The initial condition \(u \!\left( 0 \right) = 0\) implies \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = e^{u \!\left( 0 \right) } = 1 \).

\qs{1.3.18}{\(e^{d/dx} = 1 + d/dx + \frac{1}{2} \!\left( d/dx \right)^{2} + \cdots\) is a sum of higher and higher derivatives. Applying this series to \(f \!\left( x \right) \) at \(x = 0\) would give \(f + f' + \frac{1}{2} f'' + \cdots \) at \(x = 0\). The Taylor series says: This is equal to \(f \!\left( x \right) \) at \(x = \underline{\qquad}\).}

It is clearer if we say that we apply the series to \(f \!\left( a \right) \) at point \(a = 0\). The definition of the Taylor series about the point \(a = 0\) is given by
\[
	\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{\!\left( n \right) } \!\left( 0 \right) }{n!} x^{n}

Then when \(x = 1\), the Taylor (Maclaurin) series is equal to \(f \!\left( 1 \right) \):

\qs{1.3.21}{Explain why \(y_{1} = e^{\!\left( a + b + c \right) t}\) is the same as \(y_{2} = e^{at} e^{bt} e^{ct}\). They both start at \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1.\) They both solve what differential equation?}

Consider the differential equation
\[
	\frac{d y}{d t} = \!\left( a + b + c \right) y
\]
Then by property 1 of the exponential function,
\[
\frac{d y_{1}}{d t} = \!\left( a + b + c\right) e^{\!\left( a + b + c \right)t}  = \!\left( a + b + c \right) y_{1}
\]
Using the product rule, we can also derive from \(y_{2}\):
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d y_{2}}{d t} & = e^{at}e^{bt} \frac{d }{d t} e^{ct} + e^{ct} \frac{d }{d t} \!\left( e^{at}e^{bt} \right) \\
			   & = c y_{2} + e^{ct} \!\left( e^{at} \frac{d }{d t} e^{bt} + e^{bt} \frac{d }{d t} e^{at} \right) \\
			   & = c y_{2} + b y_{2} + a y_{2} \\
			   & = \!\left( a + b + c \right) y_{2}
\end{align*}

ascertaining that \(y_{1} = y_{2}\).

The second method is to begin at \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\), and go to \(e^{at}\). Let \(C = e^{at}\). Then move an additional \(e^{bt}\) and arrive at \(Ce^{bt}\). Let \(D\) equal this, and make one final additional move of \(e^{ct}\). In total, we have grown by a factor of \(e^{at}e^{bt}e^{ct}\). But this is equal to moving ahead in time by \(at + bt + ct = \!\left( a + b + c \right) t\).

\qs{1.3.22}{For \(y' = y\) with \(a = 1\), Euler's first step chooses \(Y_{1} = \!\left( 1 + \Delta t \right) Y_{0} \). Backward Euler chooses \(Y_{1} = Y_{0} / \!\left( 1 - \Delta t \right) \). Explain why \(1 + \Delta t\) is smaller than the exact \(e^{\Delta t}\) and \(1/\!\left( 1 - \Delta t \right) \) is larger than \(e^{\Delta t}\). (Compare the series for \(1/\!\left( 1 - x \right) \) with \(e^{x}\).

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Note} Section 3.5 presents an accurate Runge-Kutta method that captures three more terms of \(e^{a \Delta t}\) than Euler. For \(dy/dt = ay\) here is the step to \(Y_{n+1}\):

\textbf{Runge-Kutta for \(\bm{y' = ay}\)}

First, observe that
\[
	1 + \Delta t < 1 + \Delta t + \frac{1}{2!} \!\left( \Delta t \right)^{2} + \frac{1}{3!} \!\left( \Delta t \right)^{3} + \cdots = e^{\Delta t}
\]
Allowing us to conclude that \(1 + \Delta t < e^{\Delta t}\).

Next, consider the Taylor series for \(1/\!\left( 1-x \right) \):
\[
	\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^{2} + x^{3} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{n}
\]
Backward Euler gives us
\[
	\frac{1}{1 - \Delta t} = 1 + \Delta t + \!\left( \Delta t \right)^{2} + \!\left( \Delta t \right)^{3} + \cdots 
\]
while the Taylor expansion of \(e^{\Delta t}\) gives us
\[
	e^{\Delta t} = 1 + \Delta t + \frac{1}{2!} \!\left( \Delta t \right)^{2} + \frac{1}{3!} \!\left( \Delta t \right)^{3} + \cdots

which ascertains that \(1 / \!\left( 1 - \Delta t \right) > e^{\Delta t}\).

% QUESTION 1
\qs{1.4.1}{All solutions to \(dy/dt = -y + 2\) approach the steady state where \(dy/dt\) is zero and \(y = y_{\infty} = \underline{\qquad}\). That constant \(y = y_{\infty}\) is a particular solution \(y_{p}\).

Which \(y_{n} = Ce^{-t}\) combines with this steady state \(y_{p}\) to start from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 4\)? This question chose \(y_{p} + y_{n}\) to be \(y_{\infty} + \)\textit{transient} (decaying to zero).}

Derive
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \frac{dy}{dt} + y && = 2 \\
	&\implies && e^{t} \!\left( y' + y \right) && = 2e^{t} \\
	&\implies && \frac{d }{d t} \!\left( e^{t} y \right) && = 2e^{t} \\
	&\implies && e^{t} y \!\left( t \right) - y \!\left( 0 \right) && = \int^{t}_{0} 2e^{s} \ ds \\
	& && && = 2 \!\left( e^{t} - 1 \right) \\
	&\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = e^{-t} y \!\left( 0 \right) - 2 \!\left( e^{-t} - 1 \right) 
\end{alignat*}

Thus as \(t \rightarrow \infty\), we have \(y \!\left( t \right) \rightarrow 2 = y_{\infty}\). For \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 4\), we have \(y_{n} = 4e^{-t}\) and \(y_{p} = -2 \!\left( e^{-t} - 1 \right) \), leaving us with the complete solution

This splitting chooses the two parts \(e^{at} y \!\left( 0 \right) + \) integral of \(e^{a \!\left( t-s \right) }q\) in equation (4).}

Since \(y_{n} \!\left( 0 \right) = 4\), we have \(y_{n} \!\left( t \right) = 4e^{-t}\). The particular solution is \(y_{p} \!\left( t \right) = -2 \!\left( e^{-t} - 1 \right) \), from which we can determine \(y_{p} \!\left( 0 \right) = 0\).

1) Derive
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	 &\implies && \!\left( y' + 2y \right) && = 8  \\
	 &\implies && e^{2t} \!\left( y' + 2y \right) && = 8e^{2t}   \\ 
	 &\implies && \frac{d }{d t} \!\left( e^{2t}y \right) && = 8e^{2t} \\
	 &\implies && e^{2t} y \!\left( t \right) - y \!\left( 0 \right) && = \int^{t}_{0} 8e^{2s} \ ds \\
	 &\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = 6e^{-2t} - 4 \!\left( e^{-2t} - 1 \right)

which gives us steady and transient parts:
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \underbrace{4}_{\text{steady}} + \underbrace{2e^{-2t}}_{\text{transient}}

2) We can also think of splitting \(y \!\left( t \right) \) into its constituent null and particular solutions. For the null we have
\[
	y_{N} \!\left( t \right) = 6e^{-2t}
\]
which conforms to the initial condition \(y_{N} \!\left( 0 \right) = 6\) and solves \(y_{N}' = -2y_{N}\). Now, the particular solution is
\[
	y_{P} = -4 \!\left( e^{-2t} - 1 \right)

Taking the limit gives us \(\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} y \!\left( t \right) = y_{\infty} = 0.05\). Thus the steady state drug mass in the bloodstream is \boxed{0.05 \text{ grams}}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../chap1/sec1.4/chap1sec1.4ex13.eps}

\begin{align*}
	Y' = y' & = -6y + 0.3 \\
	 & = -6 \!\left( y - 0.05 \right)  \\ 
	 & = -6 Y
\end{align*}

\qs{1.4.14}{Why is \(y_{\infty}\) the same for \(y' + y = H \!\left( t-2 \right) \) and \(y' + y = H \!\left( t - 10 \right) \)?}

We begin with the first equation, which multiplied by integrating factor \(e^{t}\) yields:

\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{t} y \right)' && = e^{t} H \!\left( t - 2 \right)   \\
	&\implies && e^{t} y \!\left( t \right) - y \!\left( 0 \right) && = \int^{t}_{2} e^{s} \ ds   \\
	& && && = e^{t} - e^{2} \\
	&\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = e^{-t} y \!\left( 0 \right) - \!\left( e^{2 - t} - 1 \right)
\end{alignat*}

Taking the limit as \(t \rightarrow \infty\), we find
\[
	\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} y \!\left( t \right) = 1
\]

Next, we find for the second equation, with integrating factor \(e^{t}\):

\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{t}y \right)' && = e^{t} H \!\left( t - 10 \right)  \\
	&\implies && e^{t} y \!\left( t \right) - y \!\left( 0 \right) && = \int^{t}_{10} e^{s} \ ds  \\ 
	&  && && = e^{t} - e^{10} \\
	&\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = e^{-t} y \!\left( 0 \right) - \!\left( e^{10 - t} - 1 \right) 
\end{alignat*}

Analogously, we also find
\[
	\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} y \!\left( t \right)  = 1
\]
Intuitively, if we think of the Heaviside function as a switch, all that differs between the two equations is when we ``turn on" the switch to the source. The source itself has the same magnitude across the two equations, so there is no reason for the limiting behavior of \(y \!\left( t \right) \) to deviate from each other.

(a) Our integrating factor is \(e^{-5t}\). Solving the equation yields:

\begin{alignat*}{3}

Here, the asymptotic behavior of \(y \!\left( t \right) \) appears to diverge:

Integrating yields
\[
	y = R \!\left( t - 1 \right) + R \!\left( t - 2 \right) + R \!\left( t - 3 \right) 
\]
but we may simplify this result further. Recall that the definition of our ramp function \(R \!\left( t - T\right) \) is
\[
	R \!\left( t - T \right) = \begin{cases}
		t - T & t \ge T \\
		0 & t < T \\
	\end{cases}
\]
Applying this to the constituent ramp functions of \(y \!\left( t \right) \), we can derive
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \begin{cases}
		0 & 0 \le t < 1 \\
		t - 1 & 1 \le t < 2 \\
		2t - 3 & 2 \le t < 3 \\
		3 \!\left( t - 2 \right) & 3 \ge t

\]
Graphing the function, we can visually see what is happening here: as we turn on more and more switches (at times \(t = 1, 2, 3\) to more and more sources, the growth of \(y \!\left( t \right) \) happens at a steeper and steeper rate.

% QUESTION 19
\qs{1.4.19}{For all \(t > 0\) find these integrals \(a \!\left( t \right) , b \!\left( t \right), c \!\left( t \right) \) of point sources and graph \(b \!\left( t \right) \):

	\item \( {\displaystyle \int^{t}_{0} \delta \!\left( T - 2 \right) \delta \!\left( T - 3 \right)  \, dT} \)
\end{enumerate}}

(a) If \(t \ge 2\), it will be the case that the domain of integration includes the point \(T = 2\). Ergo, we have
\[
	a \!\left( t \right) = \int^{t}_{0} \delta \!\left( T - 2 \right)  \, dT = H \!\left( T - 2 \right) = \begin{cases}

Graphically, we have
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../chap1/sec1.4/chap1sec1.4ex19a.eps}
\end{center}
(b) We rewrite \(b \!\left( t \right) \) as
\[
	b \!\left( t \right) = \int^{t}_{0} \!\left( \delta \!\left( T - 2 \right) - \delta \!\left( T - 3 \right)  \right)  \, dT = \int^{t}_{0} \delta \!\left( T - 2 \right)  \, dT - \int^{t}_{0} \delta \!\left( T - 3 \right)  \, dT   
\]
Now, the value of each term is contingent on our choice of \(t\). For \(t < 2\), each term vanishes. For \(2 \le t < 3\), the first term is 1, while the second term vanishes. Lastly, for \(t \ge 3\), both terms are 1, and the difference vanishes. Succinctly, put, we have 
\[
	\int^{t}_{0} \delta \!\left( T-2 \right)  \, dT = H \!\left( T-2 \right) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \int^{t}_{0} \delta \!\left( T-3 \right)  \, dT = H \!\left( T-3 \right)   
\]
and solve as
\[
	b \!\left( t \right) = \int^{t}_{0} \!\left( \delta \!\left( T - 2 \right) - \delta \!\left( T - 3 \right)  \right)  \, dT = \begin{cases}
		1 & 2 \le t < 3 \\
		0 & \text{otherwise} \\
	\end{cases} 
\]

Intuitively, we can interpret this as at time \(T = 2\), we ``deposit" an impulse, and at time \(T = 3\), we ``withdraw" the impulse, leaving us with nothing once more. Graphically, we represent \(b \!\left( t \right) \) as

(c) Observe that irrespective of our choice of \(t\), it cannot ever be the case that the product \(\delta \!\left( T - 2 \right) \delta \!\left( T - 3 \right) \) is equal to anything other than zero. For when either constituent of the product is non-zero, it must be the case that the other is zero. Conceptually, we may have an impulse at one time for one of the delta functions, but that means there cannot be an impulse in the other delta function. Hence,
\[
	c \!\left( t \right) = \int^{t}_{0} \delta \!\left( T - 2 \right) \delta \!\left( T - 3 \right)  \, dT = 0 \text{ for all } t

	\item \( \displaystyle \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} e^{T}\delta \!\left( t - T \right)  \, dT = e^{t} \)

(a) Recall that
\[
	\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \delta \!\left( t \right) F \!\left( t \right)  \, dt = F \!\left( 0 \right)  
\]
Therefore, we have \(F \!\left( t \right) = e^{t}\), thus
\[
	\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} e^{t} \delta \!\left( t \right)  \, dt = e^{0} = 1
\]

(b) Again invoking the aforementioned identity, we have \(F \!\left( t \right) = \delta \!\left( t \right) \), giving us
\[
	\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \!\left( \delta \!\left( t \right)  \right)^{2} \, dt = \delta \!\left( 0 \right) = \infty

(c) Here we recall the identity
\[
	\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \delta \!\left( t - T \right) F \!\left( t \right)  \, dt = F \!\left( T \right)

In the given integral equation, however, the variable of integration is \(T\). What matters is the value that \(F \!\left( T \right) = e^{T}\) takes is time \(T\) at which \(\delta \!\left( t - T \right) \) has argument zero. This is precisely when \(T = t\), hence

\qs{1.4.26}{Solve these equations \(y' - ay = Qe^{ct}\) as in (19), starting from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 2\):
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \(y' - y = 8e^{3t}\)
	\item \(y' + y = 8e^{-3t}\)
\end{enumerate}
(\textit{What is} \(y_{\infty}\)?)}

(a) Let \(y_{p} = 8Ye^{3t}\). Then \(y_{p}' = 24Ye^{3t}\) and we have, substituting \(y_{p}\) for \(y\):
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && 24Ye^{3t} - 8Ye^{3t} && = 8e^{3t} \\
	&\implies && 3Y - Y && = 1 \\ 
	&\implies && Y && = 1/2
\end{alignat*}
Thus we have that \(y_{p} = 4e^{3t}\), where the particular solution starts at \(y_{p} \!\left( 0 \right) = 4\). The null solution must start at \(-2\), and is given by
\[
	y_{n} = -2e^{t}
\]
And the complete solution is
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \underbrace{-2e^{t}}_{y_{n}} + \underbrace{4e^{3t}}_{y_{p}}
\]
with limiting behavior
\[
	\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} y \!\left( t \right) = +\infty
\]
(b) Let \(y_{p} = 8Ye^{-3t}\). Then \(y_{p}' = -24Ye^{-3t}\) and we have, substituting \(y_{p}\) for \(y\):
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && -24Ye^{-3t} + 8Ye^{-3t} && = 8e^{-3t} \\
	&\implies && -3Y + Y && = 1 \\
	&\implies && Y && = -1/2
\end{alignat*}
So we must have \(y_{p} = -4e^{-3t}\). As our particular solution begins at \(y_{p} \!\left( 0 \right) = -4\), our null solution must commence at 6, giving us
\[
	y_{n} = 6e^{-t}
\]
Thus we have complete solution
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \underbrace{6e^{-t}}_{y_{n}} \underbrace{-4e^{-3t}}_{y_{p}}
\]
with limiting behavior
\[
	\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} y \!\left( t \right) = 0

% QUESTION 27
\qs{1.4.27}{When \(c = 2.01\) is very close to \(a = 2\), solve \(y' - 2y = e^{ct}\) starting from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\). This is resonance as in equation (20). By hand or computer, draw the graph of \(y \!\left( t \right) \).}

Let \(y_{p} = Ye^{ct}\). Then \(y_{p}' = cYe^{ct}\), and substituting, we find
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && cYe^{ct} - 2Ye^{ct} && = e^{ct} \\
	&\implies && cY - 2Y = 1 \\ 
	&\implies && Y = \frac{1}{c - 2}

Thus
\[
	y_{p} = \frac{e^{ct}}{c - 2}
\]
which starts at \(y_{p} \!\left( 0 \right) = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{c-2}}\). Then \(y_{n}\) must begin at \(\displaystyle{\frac{c - 3}{c - 2}}\), giving us
\[
	y_{n} = \frac{c-3}{c-2} e^{2t}
\]
and finally, the complete solution
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \underbrace{\frac{c-3}{c-2} e^{2t}}_{y_{n}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{c-2} e^{ct}}_{y_{p}}
\]
For \(c = 2.01\), we evaluate \(y \!\left( t \right) \) as
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \underbrace{-99e^{2t}}_{y_{n}} + \underbrace{100e^{2.01t}}_{y_{p}}

% QUESTION 32
\qs{1.4.32}{Suppose you know two solutions \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) to the equation \(y' - a \!\left( t \right) y = q \!\left( t \right) \).
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Find a null solution to \(y' - a \!\left( t \right) y = 0\).
	\item Find all null solutions \(y_{n}\). Find all particular solutions \(y_{p}\).
\end{enumerate}}

(a) By premise, \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) solve the differential equation, meaning
\[
	y_{1}' - a \!\left( t \right) y_{1} = q \!\left( t \right) \qquad \text{and} \qquad y_{2}' - a \!\left( t \right) y_{2} = q \!\left( t \right) 
\]
In appealing to linearity, we can immediately deduce that the differences of the solutions, \(y_{1} - y_{2}\) and \(y_{2} - y_{1}\), are both null solutions:
\[
	\!\left( y_{1} - y_{2} \right)' - a \!\left( t \right) \!\left( y_{1} - y_{2} \right) = 0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad \!\left( y_{2} - y_{1} \right)' - a \!\left( t \right) \!\left( y_{2} - y_{1} \right) = 0
\]
(b) Once again appealing to linearity, all null solutions include solutions of the form \(\alpha \!\left( y_{1} - y_{2} \right)\) for all \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\). Moreover, observe that if we have \(\alpha y_{1}\) and \(\beta y_{2}\), we have
\[
	\alpha \!\left( y_{1}' - a \!\left( t \right) y_{1}\right) = \alpha q \!\left( t \right) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \beta \!\left( y_{2}' - a \!\left( t \right) y_{2} \right) = \beta q \!\left( t \right)  
\]
Then for any nonzero sum \(\alpha + \beta \), \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}\), we have a ``weighted average" \textbf{linear combination} of particular solutions:
\[
	\frac{\alpha }{\alpha + \beta } y_{1} + \frac{\beta }{\alpha + \beta } y_{2}

% QUESTION 33
\qs{1.4.33}{Turn back to the first page of this Section 1.4. Without looking, can you write down a solution to \(y' - ay = q \!\left( t \right) \) for all four source functions \(\bm{q }, \bm{H \!\left( t \right) }, \bm{\delta \!\left( t \right) }, \bm{e^{ct}}\)?}

For simplicity, assume \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 0\).

\(\bm{q}:\) \(y' - ay = q\)

Using integrating factor \(e^{-at}\), calculate
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{-at}y \right)' && = e^{-at} q  \\
	&\implies && e^{-at} y \!\left( t \right) && = \int^{t}_{0} e^{-as}q  \, ds   \\

\(\bm{H \!\left( t \right) }\): \(y' - ay = H \!\left( t \right) \)

Using integrating factor \(e^{-at}\), calculate
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{-at}y \right)' && = e^{-at} H \!\left( t \right)   \\
	&\implies && e^{-at} y \!\left( t \right) && = \int^{t}_{0} e^{-as} H \!\left( s \right)  \, ds  \\

\(\bm{\delta \!\left( t \right) }\): \(y' - ay = \delta \!\left( t \right) \)

Using integrating factor \(e^{-at}\), calculate

	& && && = 1 \\
	&\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = \boxed{ e^{at} }

\(\bm{e^{ct}}\): \(y' - ay = e^{ct}\)

Assume that \(a \neq c\). Using integrating factor \(e^{-at}\), calculate

	&\implies && \!\left( e^{-at}y \right)' && = e^{-at} e^{ct} \\
	&\implies && e^{-at} y \!\left( t \right) && = \int^{t}_{0} e^{-as} e^{cs} \, ds   \\ 
	& && && = \frac{1}{c - a} \!\left( e^{\!\left( c - a \right) t}- 1 \right) \\
	&\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = \boxed{\frac{e^{ct} - e^{at}}{c - a}}

Now suppose that \(a = c\). Then we have \(y' - ay = e^{at}\), and derive with integrating factor \(e^{-at}\)
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{-at}y \right)' && = e^{-at} e^{at} \\
	&\implies && e^{-at} y \!\left( t \right) && = \int^{t}_{0}  \, ds   \\

% QUESTION 35
\qs{1.4.35}{What differential equations \(y' = ay + q \!\left( t \right) \) would be solved by \(y_{1} \!\left( t \right) \) and \(y_{2} \!\left( t \right) \)? Jumps, ramps, corners -- maybe harder than expected.}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../chap1/sec1.4/ex35.png}
\end{center}
The equation for \(y_{1} \!\left( t \right) \) is
\[
	y_{1} \!\left( t \right) = a R \!\left( t \right) \!\left( 1 - H \!\left( t - 1 \right)  \right) + a R \!\left( t - 1\right) \!\left( 1 - H \!\left( t - 2 \right)  \right) 
\]
For \(y_{2} \!\left( t \right) \), we have
\[
	y_{2} \!\left( t \right) = \!\left( e^{t} - 1 \right) \!\left( 1 - H \!\left( t - 1 \right)  \right) + \!\left( e^{2 - t} - 1 \right) H \!\left( t - 1 \right) 
\]
In the case of \(y_{1} \!\left( t \right) \), differentiate to find
\begin{align*}
	y_{1}' & = a \left[ H \!\left( t \right) \!\left( 1 - H \!\left( t - 1 \right)  \right)  - R \!\left( t \right) \delta \!\left( t - 1 \right) \right] \\
	       & \quad + a \left[ H \!\left( t - 1 \right) \!\left( 1 - H \!\left( t - 2 \right)  \right)  - R \!\left( t - 1 \right) \delta \!\left( t - 2 \right) \right] 
\end{align*}
This is a complicated-looking expression, so we will go by interval and study the behavior of the derivative as \(t\) increases.

First, over \(0 \le t < 1\), we have \(y_{1}' = a\). At precisely \(t = 1\), however, the first delta function kicks in, plunging \(y_{1}'\) down to \(-\infty\) at that very instant. Moving over \(1 < t < 2\), once again, \(y_{1}'\) is \(a\). At \(t = 2\), the second delta function sends \(y_{1}'\) to \(-\infty\) once more. In succinct terms, we may represent \(y_{1}'\) as
\[
	y_{1}' = a - \delta \!\left( t - 1 \right) - \delta \!\left( t - 2 \right) 
\]
where \(a\) (referring to \(a\) in the differential equation, not in the figure) is zero, and \(q \!\left( t \right) \) is the right-hand side.

Lastly, the derivative of \(y_{2}\) is
\begin{align*}
	y_{2}' & = -\!\left( e^{t} - 1 \right) \delta \!\left( t - 1 \right) + e^{t} \!\left( 1 - H \!\left( t - 1 \right)  \right) \\
	       & \quad \!\left( e^{2-t} - 1 \right) \delta \!\left( t - 1 \right) - e^{2 - t} H \!\left( t - 1 \right) 
\end{align*}
Once again, proceeding in intervals: first consider \(0 \le t < 1\). Then \(y_{2}' = e^{t}\), which is equivalent to \(y_{2} + 1\). Next we consider \(t > 1\). Here, \(y_{2}' = -e^{2 - t}\), or \(-y_{2} - 1\). At time \(t = 1\), we have a discontinuous jump in the derivative from \(e\) to \(-e\). Thus we have
\[
	y_{2}' = \begin{cases}
		y_{2} + 1 & 0 \le t < 1  \\
		- y_{2} - 1 & t > 1 \\
	\end{cases}
\]

% QUESTION 1
\qs{1.5.1}{These steps lead again to the sinusoidal identity. This approach doesn't start with the usual formula \(\cos\left( \omega t - \phi \right) = \cos\left( \omega t \right) \cos\left( \phi \right) + \sin\left( \omega t \right) \sin\left( \phi \right)\) from trigonometry. The identity says:

\[
\textbf{If } \bm{A + iB = Re^{i \phi}} \textbf{ then } \bm{A \cos( \omega t)  + B \sin( \omega t ) = R \cos( \omega t - \phi ).}
\]
Here are the four steps to find that real part of \(Re^{i \!\left( \omega t - \phi \right) }\). Explain \(A - iB\) in Step 3.

\begin{align*}
	\bm{R \cos( \omega t - \phi )} & = \Real \left[ R e^{i \!\left( \omega t - \phi  \right) } \right] \\

	 & = \bm{A \cos (\omega t) + B \sin (\omega t) }

By the sinusoidal identity, \(A = R \cos \phi \) and \(B = R \sin \phi \). Thus \(A^{2} + B^{2} = 1 + 1 = 2\), implying \(R = \sqrt{2}\). For the phase lag, we have \(\tan \phi = 1\), implying \(\phi = \pi /4\). Thus

By the sinusoidal identity, \(A = R \cos \phi \) and \(B = R \sin \phi \). Thus \(A^{2} + B^{2} = 6^{2} + 8^{2} = 36 + 64 = 100\), implying \(R = 10\). Moreover, \(\tan \phi = 4/3\), implying \(\phi = \arctan 4/3\). Thus

Now, rewrite \(1/i \omega \) as \(\frac{1}{\omega } e^{-i \pi /2}\). Then we have

\[

Finally, we can see that the real component of \(dy_{\text{complex}} / dt\) is
\[

Then find the real and imaginary parts of \(y\). And also find those real and imaginary parts directly from \(\!\left( 2 - 3i \right) e^{i \omega t} / \!\left( 2 - 3i \right) \!\left( 2 + 3i \right) \).}

With \(2 + 3i\), we have \(R^{2} = 2^{2} + 3^{2} = 4 + 9 = 13\), implying \(R = \sqrt{13}\). Additionally, we have \(\tan \phi = 3/2\), implying \(\phi = \arctan 3/2 \). In polar form, we have
\[
	2 + 3i = \sqrt{13} e^{i \arctan 3/2}

The inverse is

(1) Here, \(A = 1\) and \(B = -1\). Then \(R^{2} = A^{2} + B^{2} = 1^{2} + \!\left( -1 \right)^{2} = 2\), implying \(R = \sqrt{2}\). Furthermore, \(\tan \phi = -1\) implies \(\phi = -\pi / 4\). Thus
\[
	\cos 3t - \sin 3t = \sqrt{2} \cos\left( 3t + \frac{\pi }{4} \right)
\]
(2) Here, \(A = \sqrt{3}\) and \(B = -1\). Then \(R^{2} = A^{2} + B^{2} = \!\left( \sqrt{3} \right)^{2} + \!\left( -1 \right)^{2} = 4\), implying \(R = 2\). Furthermore, \(\tan \phi = -1 / \sqrt{3}\) implies \(\phi = - \pi / 6\). Thus
\[
	\sqrt{3} \cos \pi t - \sin \pi t = 2 \cos\left( \pi t + \pi / 6 \right)
\]
(3) Here, \(A = 3\) and \(B = 4\). Then \(R^{2} = A^{2} + B^{2} = 3^{2} + 4^{2} = 25\), implying \(R = 5\). Furthermore, \(\tan \alpha  = 4/3\) implies \(\alpha  = \arctan 4/3\). Thus
\[

\qs{1.5.9}{Solve \(dy/dt = 2y + 3 \cos t + 4 \sin t\) after recognizing \(a\) and \(\omega \). Null solutions \(C e^{2t}\).}

Let \(y = M \cos t + N \sin t\). Then \(dy / dt = - M \sin t + N \cos t\). Subtracting \(2y\) from both sides yields
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && dy / dt - 2y && = 3 \cos t + 4 \sin t \\
	&\implies && \!\left( N - 2M \right)  \cos t - \!\left( 2N + M \right)  \sin t && = 3 \cos t + 4 \sin t 
\end{alignat*}
Here, we may conclude that \(N - 2M = 3\) and \(- \!\left( 2N + M \right)= 4\). Solving for the unknowns corresponds to the matrix equation
\[

\begin{bmatrix}
N	 \\
M	 \\

Thus we have

Let \(y = M \cos 2t + N \sin 2t\). Then \(dy/dt = - 2M \sin 2t + 2N \cos 2t\). We derive
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && dy / dt + y && = - \cos 2t \\
	&\implies && \!\left( 2N + M \right) \cos 2t + \!\left( N - 2M \right) \sin 2t && = -\cos 2t \\ 
\end{alignat*}
Allowing us to conclude \(2N + M = -1\) and \(N - 2M = 0\), or \(N = 2M\). Substitution gives us \(N = -2/5\), \(M = -1/5\), and particular solution

\qs{1.5.11}{What equation \(y' - ay = A \cos \omega t + B \sin \omega t\) is solved by \(y = 3 \cos 2t + 4 \sin 2t\)?}

We can derive \(y' = -6 \sin 2t + 8 \cos 2t\), giving us on the left-hand side:
\[
	\!\left( 8 \cos 2t - 6 \sin 2t \right) - a \!\left( 3 \cos 2t + 4 \sin 2t \right) = \!\left( 8 - 3a \right) \cos 2t - \!\left( 6 + 4a \right) \sin 2t 
\]

Thus \(A = 8 - 3a\) and \(B = - \!\left( 6 + 4a \right) \), and the desired equation is:
\[
	y' - ay = \!\left( 8 - 3a \right) \cos \omega t - \!\left( 6 + 4a \right) \sin \omega t

% QUESTION 12
\qs{1.5.12}{The particular solution to \(y' = y + \cos t\) in Section 1.4 is \(y_{p} = e^{t} \int e^{-s} \cos s \, ds\). Look this up or integrate by parts, from \(s = 0\) to \(t\). Compare this \(y_{p}\) to formula (3).}

Integrating by parts, we have
\[
	y_{p} = e^{t} \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s} \cos s \, ds 
\]
where we let \(u = e^{-s}\) and \(dv = \cos s \, ds\). Then \(du = -e^{-s} \, ds\) and \(v = \sin s\), and we have
\[
	y_{p} = e^{t} \left[ e^{-t} \sin t + \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s} \sin s \, ds   \right] 
\]
In the second term, let \(u^{*} = e^{-s}\) and \(dv^{*} = \sin s \, ds \). Then \(du^{*} = -e^{-s} \, ds \) and \(v^{*} = -\cos s\). We further evaluate as
\[
	y_{p} = e^{t} \left[ e^{-t} \sin t - e^{-t} \cos t + 1 - \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s} \cos s \, ds   \right] 
\]
Now, using our original \(y_{p}\), we can add \(e^{t} \int e^{-s} \cos s \, ds \) to both sides to derive
\begin{align*} 
	2e^{t} \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s} \cos s \, ds & = e^{t} \left[ e^{-t} \sin t - e^{-t} \cos t + 1 \right] \\
						& = \sin t - \cos t + e^{t}
\end{align*}
and concluding with
\[
	y_{p} = \frac{1}{2} \!\left( \sin t - \cos t + e^{t} \right) 
\]
Comparing to formula (3) of section 1.5, we have \(a = \omega = 1\), \(A = 1\), \(B = 0\), and as such,
\[

\qs{1.5.24}{Solve \(y' - \sqrt{3}y = \cos t + \sin t\) by the same three steps with \(a = \sqrt{3}\) and \(\omega = 1\).}

(1) We have \(A = B = 1\), so \(R = \sqrt{2}\), and \(\tan \phi = 1\) implies \(\phi = \pi / 4\). Thus by the sinusoidal identity, we have
\[
	\Real \sqrt{2} e^{i \!\left( t - \pi / 4 \right) } = \sqrt{2} \cos\left( t - \frac{\pi }{4} \right)
\]

(2) With \(a = \sqrt{3}\) and \(\omega = 1\), we have gain and phase angle

% QUESTION 25
\qs{1.5.25}{\textbf{(Challenge)} Solve \(y' - ay = A \cos \omega t + B \sin \omega t\) in two ways. First, find \(R\) and \(\phi \) on the right and \(G\) and \(\alpha \) on the left. Show that the final real solution \(RG \cos\left( \omega t - \phi - \alpha  \right)\) agrees with \(M \cos \omega t + N \sin \omega t\) in equation (2).}

We have the following quantities:
\begin{align*}
	R & = \sqrt{A^{2} + B^{2}} \\
	G & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^{2} + a^{2}}} \\ 
	\phi & = \arctan \!\left( \frac{B}{A} \right) \\
	\alpha & = \arctan \!\left( -\frac{\omega }{a} \right) + \pi 
\end{align*}
Observe the additional \(\pi \) term for \(\alpha \), which is necessary because for \(\omega\), \(a > 0\), the phase angle would be located in the second quadrant. In evaluating
\[
	RG \cos\left( \omega t - \phi - \alpha  \right)
\]
The quandary is to simplify the sum of the inverse tangent terms \(\phi \) and \(\alpha \), namely \(\phi + \alpha \). The following identity is of use to us:
\[
	\arctan a + \arctan b = \arctan \!\left( \frac{a + b}{1 - ab} \right) 
\]
We derive
\begin{align*}
	\phi + \alpha = \arctan \!\left( \frac{B}{A} \right) + \arctan \!\left( -\frac{\omega}{\alpha } \right) + \pi  & = \arctan \!\left( \frac{B/A - \omega / a}{1 + \omega B / aA} \right) + \pi  \\
	 & = \arctan \!\left( \frac{aB - \omega A}{aA + \omega B} \right) + \pi  \\ 
	 & = - \arctan \!\left( \frac{\omega A - aB}{aA + \omega B} \right) + \pi 
\end{align*}

Now, using the angle-difference trigonometric identity, we have
\[
	RG \cos\left( \omega t - \phi - \alpha  \right) = RG \left[  \cos\left( \omega t \right) \cos\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) + \sin \!\left( \omega t \right) \sin \!\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) \right]
\]
Next, using the following identities:
\[
	\cos\left( \arctan x \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^{2}}} \qquad \sin\left( \arctan x \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^{2}}}
\]
we may calculate:
\begin{align*}
	\cos\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) & = \cos\left( - \arctan \!\left( \frac{\omega A - aB}{aA + \omega B} \right) + \pi  \right) \\
	 & = -\sqrt{\frac{\!\left( aA + \omega B \right)^{2}}{\!\left( \omega A - aB \right)^{2} + \!\left( aA + \omega B \right)^{2}}} \\
	 & = -\frac{aA + \omega B}{\sqrt{\!\left( A^{2} + B^{2} \right) \!\left( \omega^{2} + a^{2} \right) }} \\
	\implies RG \cos\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) & = \boxed{-\frac{aA + \omega B}{\omega^{2} + a^{2}}} \\
	\sin\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) & = \sin\left( -\arctan \!\left( \frac{\omega A - aB}{aA + \omega B} \right) + \pi  \right) \\
		& = \frac{\omega A - aB}{\sqrt{\!\left( aB - \omega A \right)^{2} + \!\left( aA + \omega B \right)^{2}}} \\
		& = \frac{\omega A - aB}{\sqrt{\!\left( A^{2} + B^{2} \right) \!\left( \omega^{2} + a^{2} \right) }} \\
	\implies RG \sin\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) & = \boxed{\frac{\omega A - aB}{\omega^{2} + a^{2}}}
\end{align*}
where we employ the fact that
\begin{align*}
	\!\left( \omega A - aB \right)^{2} + \!\left( aA + \omega B \right)^{2} & = \omega^{2}A^{2} - 2a \omega AB + a^{2}B^{2} \\
	 & \qquad + a^{2} A^{2} + 2a \omega AB + \omega^{2} B^{2} \\ 
	 & = A^{2} \!\left( \omega^{2} + a^{2} \right) + B^{2} \!\left( \omega^{2} + a^{2} \right) \\
	 & = \!\left( A^{2} + B^{2} \right) \!\left( \omega^{2} + a^{2} \right) 
\end{align*}
Finally, we may conclude that \(RG \cos\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) = M\) and \(RG \sin\left( \phi + \alpha  \right) = N\).

Using the integrating factor \(e^{\!\left( R/L \right) t}\), we derive the null solution as
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{\!\left( R/L \right) t} I_{n} \!\left( t \right)  \right)' && = 0 \\
	&\implies && e^{\!\left( R/L \right) t} I_{n} \!\left( t \right) && = I \!\left( 0 \right)   \\
	&\implies && I_{n} \!\left( t \right) && = I \!\left( 0 \right) e^{-\!\left( R/L \right) t}

\[
	I_{p}' \!\left( t \right) + \frac{R}{L} I_{p} \!\left( t \right) = \frac{V}{L} \cos\left( \omega t \right)
\]
which we convert into a complex equation
\[
	a' \!\left( t \right) + \frac{R}{L} a \!\left( t \right) = \frac{V}{L} e^{i \omega t}
\]
Now, let \(a \!\left( t \right) = A e^{i \omega t}\). To find \(A\), derive
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && i \omega A e^{i \omega t} + \frac{R}{L} A e^{i \omega t} && = \frac{V}{L} e^{i \omega t} \\

This corresponds to gain and phase angle
\[

giving us complex solution
\[
	a \!\left( t \right) = \frac{V}{\sqrt{R^{2} + \omega^{2}L^{2}}}e^{i \!\left( \omega t - \alpha  \right) }

Lastly, taking the real component of this complex solution, we find the real particular solution:

The magnitude is \(\abs{Z} = \sqrt{R^{2} + \omega^{2}L^{2}}\). The phase angle is \(\theta = \arctan \!\left( \omega L/R \right) \).

Solving the equations gives us:

\(\bm{y' = y: }\)
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \frac{d y}{d t} && = y \\
	&\implies && \int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{du}{u}  && = \int^{t}_{0}  \, dt  \\
	&\implies && \ln\left( y \!\left( t \right)  \right) - \ln\left( y \!\left( 0 \right)  \right) && = t \\

	&\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = \frac{1}{1 - t}
\end{alignat*}

Intuitively, we must have the solution \(y \!\left( t \right) \) to \(y' = y^{2}\) grow faster, assuming that \(y^{2} > y\). But as time approaches \(t = 1\), we see that the solution to \(y' = y^{2}\) hits an asymptotic point, namely

Assume that \(Y \!\left( 0 \right) = y \!\left( 0 \right) \). Solving both equations, we find

\(\bm{Y' = 2Y:}\) Using integrating factor \(e^{-2t}\):
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && Y' - 2Y && = 0 \\
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{-2t}Y \right)' && = 0 \\
	&\implies && e^{-2t} Y \!\left( t \right) - Y \!\left( 0 \right) && = 0 \\
	&\implies && Y \!\left( t \right) && = Y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{2t}

\(\bm{y' = y + q \!\left( t \right) :}\) Using integrating factor \(e^{-t}\):

	&\implies && e^{-t} y \!\left( t \right) - y \!\left( 0 \right) && = \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s}q \!\left( s \right)  \, ds \\
	&\implies && y \!\left( t \right) && = y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{t} + e^{t} \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s}q \!\left( s \right)  \, ds 
\end{alignat*}

For \(y \!\left( t \right) = Y \!\left( t \right) \) for all time \(t\), we need to have
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{t} + e^{t} \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s} q \!\left( s \right)  \, ds && = Y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{2t}  \\
	&\implies && \int^{t}_{0} e^{-s} q \!\left( s \right)  \, ds   && = Y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{t} - Y \!\left( 0 \right) \\
	& && && = Y \!\left( 0 \right) \!\left( e^{t} - 1 \right) 
\end{alignat*}
Immediately, we can see that if
\[
	q \!\left( t \right) = Y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{2t}
\]
Then we have the desired equality. We could have also derived this solution by taking our \(Y \!\left( t \right) \) and substituting it into the second equation:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && 2Y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{2t} - Y \!\left( 0 \right) e^{2t} && = q \!\left( t \right)  \\

\(\bm{\frac{d y}{d t}  = 2y + e^{t}:}\) Using integrating factor \(e^{-2t}\), derive:

	& && && = e^{2t}
\end{alignat*}

Concluding, we see that \(y \!\left( t \right) > Y \!\left( t \right) \) for all time \(t\). We know this since \(e^{2t} > e^{t}\) for all time \(t\), so the subtraction of the \(e^{t}\) term in \(y \!\left( t \right) \) never outpaces the addition of the \(2\) factor on the \(e^{2t}\) term.

% QUESTION 15
\qs{1.6.15}{Now explain this meaning of \(G \!\left( s,t \right) \) when \(t\) \textit{is less than} \(s\). We go backwards in time. \textit{For} \(t < s\), \(G \!\left( s,t \right) \) \textit{is the value at time }\(t\) \textit{that will grow to equal} \(1\) \textit{at time} \(s\).

\vspace{12pt}

When \(t = 0\), \(G \!\left( s, 0 \right) \) is the ``present value" of a promise to pay \(\$1\) at time \(s\). If the interest rate is \(a = 0.1 = 10\%\) per year, what is the present value \(G \!\left( s,0 \right) \) of a million dollar inheritance promised in \(s = 10\) years?}

When \(t < s\), we necessarily have
\[
	G \!\left( s,t \right) = e^{\int^{t}_{s} a \!\left( T \right)   \, dT } = e^{-\int^{s}_{t} a \!\left( T \right)  \, dT } = \frac{1}{e^{\int^{s}_{t} a \!\left( T \right)  \, dT }}
\]

As \(t \rightarrow s\), \(G \!\left( s, t \right) \rightarrow 1\), and particularly -- the growth factor grows \textit{to} 1 from below. Once \(t = s \), \(G \!\left( s, t \right) = 1\). Intuitively, \(G \!\left( s,t \right) \) simply gives us the portion of the deposit at time \(t < s\); once the time hits \(s\), the deposit has fully grown to the desired amount. 

For the second question, we have
\[
	G \!\left( s,0 \right) = e^{\int^{0}_{s} 0.1 \, dT } = e^{-0.1s}

For \(s = 10\) years, the present value of the million dollar inheritance is

So at \(t = 0\), the fungus must be \(1 / 2^{10}\) pounds. Suppose now the second fungus starts at size \(2 / 2^{10} = 1 / 2^{9}\). Then when \(t = 9\), we have
\[
	y \!\left( 9 \right) = \frac{1}{2^{9}} \cdot 2^{9} = 1
\]
Thus it would take 9 days for the second fungus that is twice as large as the first to grow to one pound.

\subsection{\textsf{1.7 - The Logistic Equation}}
% QUESTION 1
\qs{1.7.1}{If \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = a/2b\), the halfway point on the \(S\)-curve is at \(t = 0\). Show that \(d = b\) and \(y \!\left( t \right) = \displaystyle{\frac{a}{de^{-at} + b} = \frac{a}{b} \frac{1}{e^{-at} + 1}}\). Sketch the curve from \(y_{-\infty} = 0\) to \(y_{\infty} = \displaystyle{\frac{a}{b}}\).}

Given the logistic equation
\[
	\frac{d y}{d t} = ay - by^{2}
\]
We let \(z = 1/y\), implying that
\[
	\frac{d z}{d t} = -\frac{1}{y^{2}} \frac{d y}{d t} 
\]
Thus we can rewrite the logistic equation as
\[
	\frac{d z}{d t} = -\frac{1}{y^{2}} \!\left( ay - by^{2} \right) = - \!\left( \frac{a}{y} - b \right) = -az + b
\]
which has solution
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\implies && \frac{d z}{d t}  + az && = b \\
	&\implies && \!\left( e^{at}z \right)' && = b e^{at} \\ 
	&\implies && e^{at} z \!\left( t \right) - z \!\left( 0 \right) && = \int^{t}_{0} be^{at} \, dt \\
	& && && = \frac{b}{a} \!\left( e^{at} - 1 \right)  \\
	&\implies && z \!\left( t \right) && = e^{-at} z \!\left( 0 \right) + \frac{b}{a} \!\left( 1 - e^{-at} \right) 
\end{alignat*}

Now let \(d/a = z \!\left( 0 \right) - b/a\). Since \(z \!\left( 0 \right) = 1/y \!\left( 0 \right) \), we have \(d = a / y \!\left( 0 \right) - b\). Then we may write
\[
	z \!\left( t \right) = \frac{d e^{-at} + b}{a}
\]
Finally implying
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \frac{a}{de^{-at} + b}
\]
Now, for \(\displaystyle{y \!\left( 0 \right) = \frac{a}{2b}}\), our parameter \(d\) is
\[
	d = \frac{a}{a / 2b} - b = 2b - b = b
\]
enabling us to conclude
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \frac{a}{b} \frac{1}{e^{-at} + 1}
\]
The curve is graphed as

% QUESTION 2
\qs{1.7.2}{If the carrying capacity of the Earth is \(K = a/b = 14\) billion people, what will be the population at the inflection point? What is \(dy/dt\) at that point? The actual population was 7.14 billion on January 1, 2014.}

The inflection point is at \(y \!\left( t \right) = a / 2b\), or
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \frac{a}{2b} = 7 \text{ billion people}
\]
The natural growth rate \(a\) is estimated to be \(.029\) per year. Then we have
\[
	b = \frac{a}{K} = \frac{.029}{14 \cdot 10^{9}} \approx 2.1 \cdot 10^{-12}
\]
which corresponds to \(dy/dt\):
\[
	\frac{d y}{d t} = 0.029 \!\left( 7 \cdot 10^{9} \right)  - \!\left( 2.1 \cdot 10^{-12} \right) \!\left( 7 \cdot 10^{9} \right)^{2} \approx 10^{8} 
\]

% QUESTION 3
\qs{1.7.3}{Equation (18) must give the same formula for the solution \(y \!\left( t \right) \) as equation (16). If the right side of (18) is called \(R\), we can solve that equation for \(y\):
\[
	y = R \!\left( 1 - \frac{b}{a}y \right) \quad \rightarrow \quad \!\left( 1 + R \frac{b}{a} \right) y = R \quad \rightarrow \quad y = \frac{R}{\!\left( 1 + R \frac{b}{a} \right) }
\]
Simplify that answer by algebra to recover equation (16) for \(y \!\left( t \right) \).}

Equation (18) is given by
\[
	\frac{y}{1 - \frac{b}{a}y} = e^{at} \frac{y \!\left( 0 \right) }{1 - \frac{b}{a} y \!\left( 0 \right) } = R
\]

Which we solve by
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	\implies && y & = R \!\left( 1 - \frac{b}{a}y \right)  \\
	\implies && \!\left( 1 + R \frac{b}{a} \right) y & = R \\ 
	\implies && y & = \frac{R}{\!\left( 1 + R \frac{b}{a} \right) } 
\end{alignat*}

Now, define \(d\) as
\[
	d = \frac{a}{y \!\left( 0 \right) - b}
\]
Then we may write \(R\) as
\[
	R = e^{at} \!\left( \frac{a}{d} \right) 
\]
which is more compact to work with. Then we continue with
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies && y & = \frac{e^{at} \!\left( \frac{a}{d} \right) }{1 + \!\left( \frac{b}{a} \right) e^{at} \!\left( \frac{a}{d} \right) } \\
	\implies && y & = \frac{e^{at} \!\left( \frac{a}{d} \right) }{\!\left( d + be^{at} \right) / d}  \\ 
	\implies && y & = \frac{ae^{at}}{d + be^{at}} \\
	\implies && y & = \frac{a}{de^{-at} + b}
\end{alignat*}

Deriving the desired result, equation (16).

% QUESTION 4
\qs{1.7.4}{Change the logistic equation to \(y' = y + y^{2}\). Now the nonlinear term is positive, and \textit{cooperation of} \(y\) \textit{with} \(y\) promotes growth. Use \(z = 1/y\) to find and solve a linear equation for \(z\), starting from \(z \!\left( 0 \right) = y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\). Show that \(y \!\left( T \right) = \infty\) when \(e^{-T} = 1/2\). Cooperation looks bad, the population will explode at \(t = T\).}

Given \(y' = y + y^{2}\), let \(z = 1/y\). Then
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies && z' & = -\frac{1}{y^{2}}y' \\
	&& & = -\frac{1}{y} - 1 \\ 
	&& & = - \!\left( z + 1 \right) 
\end{alignat*}

Writing \(z'\) as \(\displaystyle{\frac{d z}{d t} }\) and separating variables, we can write

\begin{alignat*}{2}
	\implies && \frac{d z}{d t}  & = - \!\left( z + 1 \right)  \\
	\implies && - \int^{z \!\left( t \right) }_{z \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dz}{z + 1}  & = \int^{t}_{0} \, dt  \\ 
	\implies && -\ln\left( z \!\left( t \right) + 1 \right) + \ln\left( 2 \right) & = t \\
	\implies && \ln\left( \frac{2}{z \!\left( t \right)  + 1} \right) & = t \\
	\implies && \frac{2}{z \!\left( t \right) + 1} & = e^{t} \\
	\implies && z \!\left( t \right) & = 2e^{-t} - 1 \\
	\implies && y \!\left( t \right) & = \frac{1}{2e^{-t} - 1}
\end{alignat*}

Clearly, we have \(z \!\left( 0 \right) = y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\). Now, suppose that we have
\[
	\lim\limits_{T \to \ln\left( 2 \right)} e^{-T} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Then it must follow that
\[
	\lim\limits_{T \to \ln\left( 2 \right)}  y \!\left( t \right) = \lim\limits_{T \to \ln\left( 2 \right)} \frac{1}{2e^{-t} - 1} = \infty

Which indicates an explosion of population as \(T\) approaches \(\ln\left( 2 \right)\).

% QUESTION 5
\qs{1.7.5}{The US population grew from 313,873,685 in 2012 to 316,128,839 in 2014. If it were following a logistic \(S\)-curve, what equations would give you \(a\), \(b\), \(d\) in the formula (4)? Is the logistic equation reasonable and how to account for immigration?}

Suppose we set \(t = 0\) as corresponding to 2012. Then \(t = 2\) corresponds to 2014. We have
\[
	y \!\left( 0 \right) = \frac{a}{d + b} = 313,873,685 \quad \text{and} \quad y \!\left( 2 \right) = \frac{a}{de^{-2a} + b} = 316,128,839
\]
Due to the nonlinearity, it is not readily clear how we identify the corresponding logistic equation that fits these points. As far as immigration goes, suppose we add the constant harvesting rate \(-h\) to the logistic equation:
\[
	\frac{d y}{d t} = ay - by^{2} - h
\]
Since immigration would lead to an \textit{increase} in \(dy/dt\), we must have \(h < 0\). By contrast, \textit{emigration decreases} \(dy/dt\), corresponding to \(h > 0\).

% QUESTION 6
\qs{1.7.6}{The \textbf{Bernoulli equation} \(y' = ay - by^{n}\) has competition term \(by^{n}\). Introduce \(z = y^{1-n}\) which matches the logistic case when \(n = 2\). Follow equation (4) to show that \(z' = \!\left( n - 1 \right) \!\left( -az + b \right) \). Write \(z \!\left( t \right) \) as in (5)-(6). Then you have \(y \!\left( t \right) \).}

Let \(z = y^{1-n}\). Then we have
\[
	z' = \!\left( 1-n \right) y^{-n} y'
\]

and are able to derive
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	\implies && z' & = \!\left( 1 - n \right) \!\left(ay^{1-n} - b\right) \\
	&& & = \!\left( n - 1 \right) \!\left( -az + b \right)

Separating variables, we can conclude with
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	\implies && \frac{d z}{d t}  & = \!\left( n - 1 \right) \!\left( -az + b \right)  \\
	\implies && \int^{z \!\left( t \right) }_{z \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dz}{-az + b}  & = \int^{t}_{0} \!\left( n - 1 \right)  \, dt  \\

	\implies && \frac{-a z \!\left( t \right) + b}{-a z \!\left( 0 \right) + b} & = e^{-a \!\left( n - 1 \right) t} \\
	\implies && z \!\left( t \right) & = -\frac{1}{a} \!\left( \!\left( -a z \!\left( 0 \right) + b \right) e^{a \!\left( 1 - n \right) t} - b \right) \\ 
		 && & = z \!\left( 0 \right) e^{a \!\left( 1 - n \right) t} - \frac{b}{a} \!\left( e^{a \!\left( 1 - n \right) t} - 1 \right) 
\end{alignat*}

Now, define \(d\) as
\[
	d = \frac{a}{y \!\left( 0 \right) } - b
\]
Then we have
\[
	z \!\left( t \right) = \frac{de^{a \!\left( 1 - n \right) t} + b}{a}
\]
Finally implying
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \frac{a}{de^{-a \!\left( n - 1 \right) t} + b}
\]

% QUESTION 7
\qs{1.7.7}{\(y' = y - y^{2}\) is solved by \(y \!\left( t \right) = 1 / \!\left( de^{-t} + 1 \right) \). This is an \(S\)-curve when \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1/2\) and \(d = 1\). But show that \(y \!\left( t \right) \) is very different if \(y \!\left( 0 \right) > 1\) or if \(y \!\left( 0 \right) < 0\).

If \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 2\) then \(d = \frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{1}{2}\). Show that \(y \!\left( t \right) \rightarrow 1\) from above.

If \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = -1\) then \(d = \frac{1}{-1} - 1 = -2\). At what time \(T\) is \(y \!\left( T \right) = -\infty\)?}

Suppose that \(y \!\left( 0 \right) > 1\). Then we have
\[
	d = \frac{1}{y \!\left( 0 \right) } - 1 < 0
\]
We can also determine that \(y \!\left( 0 \right) < 0\) leads to the same result: \(d\) \textit{is negative.} When \(d\) is negative, then we have a discontinuity at \(t\) when \(de^{-t} + 1 = 0\). The \(S\)-curve has no such discontinuity, so there is a stark difference when the initial condition \(y \!\left( 0 \right) \) meets the aforementioned values.

Suppose that \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 2\). Then \(d = -1/2\). The steady state is \(a/b = 1/1 = 1\). We have
\[
	\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{-\frac{1}{2}e^{-t} + 1} = 1

The point where approaching \(t = T\) corresponds to \(y \!\left( t \right) \) tending towards \(-\infty\) is where the denominator approaches zero. This time \(t = T\) is thus at

For the harvesting equation, we have steady states

Allowing for the decomposition

Our steady states are \(y_{\infty}, y_{-\infty} = K, L\). Then for the general equation \(f \!\left( y \right) = ay - by^{2} - h\), we must have
\begin{align*}

Let's solve this equation. By separable variables, we find

\qs{1.7.13}{With overharvesting, every curve \(y \!\left( t \right) \) drops to \(-\infty\). There are no steady states. Solve \(Y - Y^{2} - h= 0\) (quadratic formula) to find only complex roots if \(4h > 1\).

The solutions for \(h = \frac{5}{4}\) are \(y \!\left( t \right) = \frac{1}{2} - \tan \!\left( t + C \right) \). Sketch that dropoff if \(C = 0\). Animal populations don't normally collapse like this from overharvesting.}

By the quadratic formula, we have

\[
	Y = -\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4h}}{2}

which leads to complex roots if \(4h > 1\). To solve this equation, we rewrite \(y - y^{2} - 5/4\) as
\[
	y - y^{2} - \frac{5}{4} = -\!\left( y - \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} - 1
\]
We then solve the equation

\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies && \frac{d y}{d t}   & = - \!\left( y - \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} - 1 \\
	\implies && -\int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dy}{\!\left( y - 1/2 \right)^{2} + 1}  & = \int^{t}_{0}  \, dt  \\

Now let \(\tan^{-1} \!\left( y \!\left( 0 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \right) \) be a constant \(C\). We have

\qs{1.7.14}{With \textbf{two partial fractions}, this is my preferred way to find \(\displaystyle{A = \frac{1}{r - s}}\), \(\displaystyle{B = \frac{1}{s - r}}\)
\[
	\boxed{\textbf{PF2}} \quad \bm{\frac{1}{\!\left( y - r \right) \!\left( y - s \right)} = \frac{1}{\!\left( y - r \right) \!\left( r - s \right) } + \frac{1}{\!\left( y - s \right) \!\left( s - r \right) }}	
\]
Check that equation: The common denominator on the right is \(\!\left( \bm{y - r} \right) \!\left( \bm{y - s} \right) \!\left( \bm{r - s} \right) \). The numerator should cancel the \(\bm{r - s}\) when you combine the two fractions.
\[
	\text{Separate } \frac{1}{y^{2} - 1} \text{ and } \frac{1}{y^{2} - y} \text{ into two fractions } \frac{A}{y - r} + \frac{B}{y - s}.
\]
\textit{Note} When \(y\) approaches \(r\), the left side of \textbf{PF2} has a blowup factor \(1 / \!\left( y - r \right) \). The other factor \(1 / \!\left( y - s \right) \) correctly approaches \(A = 1/ \!\left( r - s \right) \). So the right side \textbf{of PF2} needs the same blowup at \(y = r\). The first term \(A / \!\left( y - r \right) \) fits the bill.}

To solve PF2, write
\begin{alignat*}{3}

% QUESTION 15
\qs{1.7.15}{The \textbf{threshold equation} is the logistic equation backward in time:
\[
	-\frac{d y}{d t} = ay - by^{2} \quad \text{is the same as} \quad \frac{d y}{d t} = -ay + by^{2}
\]
Now \(Y = 0\) is the stable steady state. \(Y = a/b\) is the unstable state (why?). If \(y \!\left( 0 \right) \) is below the threshold \(a/b\) then \(y \!\left( t \right) \rightarrow 0\) and the species will die out.

Graph \(y \!\left( t \right) \) with \(y \!\left( 0 \right) < a/b\) (reverse \(S\)-curve). Then graph \(y \!\left( t \right) \) with \(y \!\left( 0 \right) > a/b\).}

Given the equation
\[
	-\frac{d y}{d t} = ay - by^{2}
\]
We let \(z = 1/y\), implying that
\[
	\frac{d z}{d t} = -\frac{1}{y^{2}} \frac{d y}{d t} 
\]
Thus we may rewrite our equation as
\[
	\frac{d z}{d t} = \frac{a}{y} - b = az - b
\]
and solve as follows:

\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies &&\int^{z \!\left( t \right) }_{z \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dz}{az - b}  & = \int^{t}_{0}  \, dt  \\
	\implies && \frac{1}{a} \left[ \ln\left( a z \!\left( t \right) - b \right) - \ln\left( a z \!\left( 0 \right) - b \right) \right]  & = t \\ 
	\implies && \frac{a z \!\left( t \right) - b}{a z \!\left( 0 \right) - b} & = e^{at} \\
	\implies && z \!\left( t \right) & = \left[ \!\left( a z \!\left( 0 \right) - b \right) e^{at} + b \right] \\
		 && & = z \!\left( 0 \right) e^{at} + \frac{b}{a} \!\left( 1 - e^{at} \right) 
\end{alignat*}
Now, define
\[
	\frac{d}{a} = z \!\left( 0 \right) - \frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{y \!\left( 0 \right) - \frac{b}{a}}
\]
Then our equation for \(z \!\left( t \right) \) can be compactly written as
\[
	z \!\left( t \right) = \frac{de^{at} + b}{a}
\]
and thus, our equation for \(y \!\left( t \right) \) is
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \frac{a}{de^{at} + b}
\]
This is the complete derivation for the threshold equation, but intuitively, we need only realize that since the threshold equation is the logistic equation run backwards in time, we need only amend the solution to the logistic equation by taking the negative of time \(t\).

Now, if \(f \!\left( y \right) = -ay + by^{2}\), observe that
\[
	\frac{d f}{d y} = -a + 2by
\]
When \(Y = 0\) and \(Y = a/b\), we have, respectively,

	\frac{d f}{d y}_{\!\left( Y = 0 \right) } & = - a < 0 && \quad \text{(stable)} \\
	\frac{d f}{d y}_{\!\left( Y = a/b \right) } & = a > 0 && \quad \text{(unstable)}

% QUESTION 16
\qs{1.7.16}{(Cubic nonlinearity) The equation \(y' = y \!\left( 1 - y \right) \!\left( 2 - y \right) \) has \textbf{three steady states}: \(Y = 0, 1, 2\). By computing the derivative \(df /dy\) at \(y = 0, 1, 2\), decide whether each of these states is stable or unstable.

Draw the \textit{stability line} for this equation, to show \(y \!\left( t \right) \) leaving the unstable \(Y\)'s. Sketch a graph that shows \(y \!\left( t \right) \) starting from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{3}{2}\) and \(\frac{5}{2}\).}

Given \(f \!\left( y \right) = y \!\left( 1 - y \right) \!\left( 2 - y \right) \), we have
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d f}{d y} & = \!\left( 1 - y \right) \!\left( 2 - y \right) + y \left[ - \!\left( 2 - y \right) - \!\left( 1 - y \right)  \right] \\
			& = \!\left( 2 - 3y + y^{2} \right) + y \!\left( - 3 + 2y \right) \\
			& = \!\left( 2 - 3y + y^{2} \right) - 3y + 2y^{2} \\
			& = 2 - 6y + 3y^{2}  
\end{align*}
At the values \(y = 0, 1, 2\), we have
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d f}{d y}_{\!\left( y = 0 \right)} & = 2 \\
	\frac{d f}{d y}_{\!\left( y = 1 \right) } & = -1 \\ 
	\frac{d f}{d y}_{\!\left( y = 2 \right) } & = 2
\end{align*}

Therefore, \(Y = 1\) is a stable state, while \(Y = 0, 2\) are unstable.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../chap1/sec1.7/c1s7q16.eps}
\end{center}

Using the stability line, we can capture the trajectories that beginning at different initial conditions takes us on. Starting from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1/2 \), we can observe that \(y \!\left( t \right) \) approaches \(Y = 1\). So too when we begin at \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 3/2\). However, when we commence at \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 5/2\), \(y \!\left( t \right) \) diverges to \(+\infty\).

The equation really needs to be solved numerically. You can start to attempt an analytic approach by separable variables, and writing
\[
	\int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dY}{Y \!\left( 1 - Y \right) \!\left( 2 - Y  \right) } = \int^{t}_{0}  \, dT
\]

Using partial fractions decomposition, the left-hand side is equal to
\[
	\int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \!\left(  \frac{1}{2Y} + \frac{1}{1 - Y} - \frac{1}{2 \!\left( 2 - Y \right) }\right) \, dY 
\]
Multiply the integrand through by \(2\) (you'll see why in a moment). Enabling us to solve as follows:
\begin{align*}
	\left[ \ln\left( Y \right) - \ln\left( 1 - Y \right)^{2} - \ln\left( \!\left( 2 - Y \right) \right) \right]  \Biggr|^{y \!\left( t \right)}_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } & = \ln\left( \frac{y \!\left( t \right)}{\!\left( 1 - y \!\left( t \right)  \right)^{2} \!\left( 2 - y \!\left( t \right)  \right)} \right) \\ 
 	  & \ - \ln\left( \frac{y \!\left( 0 \right)}{\!\left( 1 - y \!\left( 0 \right)  \right)^{2} \!\left( 2 - y \!\left( 0 \right)  \right) } \right) \\ 
\end{align*}

Let the second term equal a constant \(-c\). On the right-hand side, we have
\[
	\int^{t}_{0} 2 \, dT = 2t 
\]
Equating both sides and exponentiating, we have
\[
	\frac{y \!\left( t \right) }{\!\left( 1 - y \!\left( t \right)  \right)^{2} \!\left( 2 - y \!\left( t \right)  \right) } = Ce^{2t}
\]
where \(C = e^{c}\). Let me know if you find a way to analytically proceed!

\qs{1.7.17}{\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Find the steady states of the \textbf{Gompertz equation} \(dy / dt = y \!\left( 1 - \ln\left( y \right) \right) \).
	\item Show that \(z = \ln\left( y \right)\) satisfies the linear equation \(dz / dt = 1 - z\).
	\item The solution \(z \!\left( t \right) = 1 + e^{-t} \!\left( z \!\left( 0 \right) - 1 \right) \) gives what formula for \(y \!\left( t \right) \) from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) \)?
\end{enumerate}}

\textbf{(a)} The unambiguous steady state is \(Y = e\). Technically, the Gompertz equation \(f \!\left( y \right) = y \!\left( 1 - \ln\left( y \right) \right) \) is not defined at \(Y = 0\). It seems that the author considers \(Y = 0\) as a second steady state, however.

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{(b)} From the definition of \(z\), we have
\[
	\frac{d z}{d t} = \frac{1}{y} \frac{d y}{d t} 
\]
By (a), we then derive
\[
	\frac{d z}{d t} = \frac{1}{y} \left[ y \!\left( 1 - \ln\left( y \right) \right)  \right] = 1 - \ln\left( y \right) = 1 - z 
\]

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{(c)} We can rewrite this solution as
\[
	\ln\left( y \!\left( t \right)  \right) = 1 + e^{-t} \!\left( \ln\left( y \!\left( 0 \right) \right) - 1 \right) 
\]
Exponentiating yields
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = \exp\left( 1 + e^{-t} \!\left( \ln\left( y \!\left( 0 \right)  \right) - 1 \right)  \right)
\]

Now, observe that	
\[
	\frac{d f}{d y} = - \ln\left( y \right)
\]
When \(Y = 0 + \epsilon \), for real, positive, and arbitrarily small \(\epsilon \), we have \(df / dy > 0\), so we have an unstable steady state. By contrast, when \(Y = e\), \(df / dy < 0\), a stable steady state.

Graph those values \(Y \!\left( a \right) \) to see a \textit{pitchfork bifurcation}--new steady states suddenly appear as \(a\) passes zero. The graph of \(Y \!\left( a \right) \) looks like a pitchfork.}

\(\bm{a > 0}\): In the case where \(a\) is positive, we certainly have \(Y = 0\) as one steady state. Then we must also have \(Y = \pm \sqrt{a}\) as two other steady states. 

To derive the stability, calculate
\[
	\frac{d f}{d y} = a - 3y^{2}
\]
which corresponds to
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	&\frac{d f}{d y}_{\!\left( Y = -\sqrt{a} \right) } && = -2a < 0 & \text{(stable)} \\

\(\bm{a < 0}\): When \(a\) is negative, we only have \(Y = 0\) as the steady state (as far as real roots go, and we stay in the realm of the reals for now).

Since \(a < 0\), \(df/dy = a < 0\) implies that the steady state is stable.

% QUESTION 22
\qs{1.7.22}{Change Problem 21 to \(dy/dt = \!\left( \sin y \right)^{2}\). The steady states are the same, but now the derivative of \(f \!\left( y \right) = \!\left( \sin y \right)^{2}\) is zero at all those states (because \(\sin y\) is zero). What will the solution actually do if \(y \!\left( 0 \right) \) is between two steady states?}

Here, we have
\[
	\frac{d f}{d y} = 2 \sin y \cos y = \sin 2y
\]
where for \(Y\) such that \(f \!\left( Y \right) = 0\), we also have \(df/dy = 0\). These \(Y\)'s are of the form
\[
	Y = n \pi 
\]

for all integers \(n\).

At the moment, it is ambiguous as to what type of stability each steady state is in. In fact, we call this \textbf{marginal stability}. To further investigate, we must go to the \textbf{second derivative} of \(f \!\left( y \right) \). To motivate this, let \(Y\) be our steady state, and let \(\epsilon \!\left( t \right) \) be some small perturbation around the steady state. Our \(y \!\left( t \right) \) is given by
\[
	y \!\left( t \right) = Y + \epsilon \!\left( t \right) 
\]
Differentiating both sides, taking into account that \(Y\) is a constant, we derive
\[
	y' \!\left( t \right) = \epsilon' \!\left( t \right) 
\]
And since \(y' \!\left( t \right) = f \!\left( y \right) \), we have
\[
	\epsilon' \!\left( t \right) = f \!\left( Y + \epsilon \!\left( t \right)  \right) 
\]
Using the Taylor series expansion, we may write
\[
	\epsilon' \!\left( t \right) = f \!\left( Y \right) + \epsilon f' \!\left( Y \right) + \epsilon^{2} f'' \!\left( Y \right) / 2 + \cdots 
\]
Note that the first two terms on the right side vanish, since \(f \!\left( Y \right) = f' \!\left( Y \right) = 0\). We should also ignore higher-order terms. That leaves us with the approximation
\[
	\epsilon' \!\left( t \right) \approx \epsilon^{2} f'' \!\left( Y \right) /2
\]
Now in this case, observe that
\[
	f'' \!\left( y \right) = 2 \left( \cos^{2}y - \sin^{2}y \right) = 2 \cos 2y
\]

We can conclude that for any of our aforementioned steady states \(Y\), which are of form \(n \pi \) for integers \(n\), it \textit{must} be the case that
\[
	f''\!\left( Y \right) > 0
\]
Moreover, since \(\epsilon^{2}\) is always positive irrespective of the value of \(\epsilon \!\left( t \right) \), we can now conclude that
\[
	\epsilon' \!\left( t \right) > 0
\]
Therefore, going back to the equality between \(y'\!\left( t \right) \) and \(\epsilon' \!\left( t \right) \), it immediately follows that
\[
	y'\!\left( t \right) > 0
\]
So for any perturbation \(\epsilon \!\left( t \right) \), we will have increasing \(y \!\left( t \right) \), meaning that \(y \!\left( t \right) \) will indefinitely move to successively higher steady states \(Y\).\footnote{\href{https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Differential_Equations/Differential_Equations_(Chasnov)/08\%3A_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations/8.01\%3A_Fixed_Points_and_Stability}{See this LibreText chapter on fixed points and stability here.}}

\textbf{(b)} Here, we must have \(Y = 4\) and \(Y = -2\) as stable steady states, and \(Y = 0\) as an unstable steady state. One approach is to define a piecewise function as follows:
\[
	f \!\left( y \right) = \begin{cases}
		-2 - y & y \le -1 \\
		y & -1 < y \le 2 \\
		4 - y & 2 < y \\

which is consistent with the stability of each of the steady states:

	&\frac{d f}{d y}_{\!\left( Y = 0 \right) } && = & 1 \\

% QUESTION 26
\qs{1.7.26}{Which exponents \(n\) in \(dy/dt = y^{n}\) produce blowup \(y \!\left( T \right) = \infty\) in a finite time? You could separate the equation into \(dy/y^{n} = dt\) and integrate from \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = 1\).}

First consider the case that \(n = 1\). Then we have
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies && \int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dy}{y} & = \int^{t}_{0} \, dT \\
	\implies && \ln\left( y \!\left( t \right)  \right) - \ln\left( y \!\left( 0 \right)  \right) & = t \\ 
	\implies&& y \!\left( t \right) & = e^{t}
\end{alignat*}
which does \textbf{not} blowup to \(\infty\) in a finite time. In the general case, however, we have
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies &&\int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dy}{y^{n}} & = \int^{t}_{0}  \, dT  \\
	\implies &&-\frac{1}{n-1} \!\left( y^{-\!\left( n - 1 \right) } - 1 \right) & = t \\ 
	\implies&& y^{n-1} \!\left( t \right) & = \frac{1}{1 - \!\left( n - 1 \right) t} 
\end{alignat*}

where it is apparent that \(y \!\left( t \right) \) diverges to infinity at finite time for
\[
	T = \frac{1}{n - 1}
\]
We may conclude that for \(n > 1\), there exists a finite time \(T\) where \(y \!\left( t \right) \) diverges to infinity.

\qs{1.7.27}{Find the steady states of \(dy/dt = y^{2} - y^{4}\) and decide whether they are stable, unstable, or one-sided stable. Draw a stability line to show the final value \(y \!\left( \infty \right) \) from each initial value \(y \!\left( 0 \right) \).}

Given \(f \!\left( y \right) = y^{2} - y^{4}\), we have \(Y = \pm 1\) and \(Y = 0\) corresponding to \(f \!\left( Y \right) = 0\).
\[
	f'\!\left( y \right) = 2y - 4y^{3}
\]
For \(Y = 1\), we have \(f'\!\left( Y = 1 \right) = -2 < 0\), a stable steady state. Conversely, for \(Y = -1\), we have \(f' \!\left( Y = -1 \right) = 2 > 0\), an unstable steady state.

The remaining steady state at \(Y = 0\) is somewhat problematic. Following the logic of question 1.7.22, we take the second derivative of \(f \!\left( y \right) \) to get
\[
	f''\!\left( y \right) = 2 - 12y^{2}
\]
which, for \(f''\!\left( Y = 0 \right) = 2 > 0\), implies that for any perturbation \(\epsilon \!\left( t \right) \), we have \(\epsilon' \!\left( t \right) > 0\), implying that \(y'\!\left( t \right) > 0\), and thus increasing \(y \!\left( t \right) \).

% QUESTION 28
\qs{1.7.28}{For an autonomous equation \(y' = f \!\left( y \right) \), why is it impossible for \(y \!\left( t \right) \) to be increasing at one time \(t_{1}\) and decreasing at another time \(t_{2}\)?}

The crux of the explanation has to do with \textbf{steady states}. First consider the case where either \(y \!\left( 0 \right) \) lies above or below a stable steady state. We can think of a stable steady state as a kind of ``attractor''; a magnet or celestial body that pulls a point particle onto it. 

In this case, the point particle moves \textbf{monotonically} in \textbf{one} direction towards the stable steady state, so we cannot have \(y'\!\left( t_{1} \right) > 0\) and \(y'\!\left( t_{2} \right) < 0\), \(t_{1} \neq t_{2}\), simultaneously.

In the case where there is no stable steady state (such as in the overharvesting case), \(y \!\left( t \right) \) diverges to \(-\infty\) -- once again, monotonically.

Let \(y \!\left( 0 \right) = a\). Then we have

In general, \(y \!\left( t \right) \) blows up at \(t = 1/a\). Suppose that \(a \le 0\). Then the denominator \(1 - at\) never approaches zero, so \(y \!\left( t \right) \) never diverges to infinity.

The exactness condition is met when

Here, we are given
\[

Thus we must have
\[

Implying that \(A = a\). First, we find \(F \!\left( y,t \right) + C \!\left( t \right) \):
\[

% QUESTION 15
\qs{1.8.15}{Show that \(\displaystyle{\frac{d y}{d t} = -\frac{y^{2}}{2ty}}\) is exact but the same equation \(\displaystyle{\frac{d y}{d t} = -\frac{y}{2t}}\) is not exact. Solve both equations. (This problem suggests that many equations become exact when multiplied by an integrating factor.)}

In the first case, we have \(g \!\left( y,t \right) = -y^{2}\) and \(f \!\left( y,t \right) = 2ty\). Then
\[
	\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = -2y = -\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} 
\]
In the second case, \(g \!\left( y,t \right) = -y\) and \(f \!\left( y,t \right) = 2t\), establishing
\[
	\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = -1 \neq -2 = -\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} 
\]
We solve the first equation as follows: first integrate \(f \!\left( y,t \right) \) with respect to \(y\):
\[
	\int 2ty \, dy = ty^{2}	+ C \!\left( t \right) 
\]
and then differentiate with respect to \(t\):
\[
	\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \!\left( F \!\left( y,t \right) + C \!\left( t \right)  \right) = y^{2} + C'\!\left( t \right) 
\]
which itself is equal to \(-g \!\left( y,t \right) \), allowing us to deduce
\[
	C'\!\left( t \right) = 0 \quad \implies C \!\left( t \right) = c
\]
where \(c\) is a constant. Then the equation is solved by
\[
	F \!\left( y,t \right) + C \!\left( t \right) = ty^{2} + c
\]
The second equation is separable, so we write
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies && \int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dy}{y}  & = -\int^{t}_{t \!\left( 0 \right) } \frac{dt}{2t}  \\
	\implies && \ln\left( \frac{y \!\left( t \right) }{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \right) & = -\frac{1}{2} \ln\left( \frac{t}{t \!\left( 0 \right) } \right) \\
	\implies && y \!\left( t \right) & = y \!\left( 0 \right) \!\left( \frac{t}{t \!\left( 0 \right) } \right)^{-1/2}
\end{alignat*}

% QUESTION 16
\qs{1.8.16}{Exactness is really the condition to solve two equations with the same function \(H \!\left( t,y \right) \):
\[
	\frac{\partial H}{\partial y} = f \!\left( t,y \right) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = - g \!\left( t,y \right) \quad \text{can be solved if} \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}

Take the \(t\) derivative of \(\partial H / \partial y\) and the \(y\) derivative of \(\partial H / \partial t\) to show that exactness is \textit{necessary}. It is also \textit{sufficient} to guarantee that a solution \(H\) will exist.}

We have
\[
	\frac{d }{d t} \frac{\partial H}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \!\left( t,y \right)  \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d }{d y} \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \!\left( t,y \right)

% QUESTION 20
\qs{1.8.20}{An \textbf{autonomous equation} \(\bm{y' = f \!\left( y \right) }\) has no terms that contain \(t\) (\(t\) is missing).

\vspace{12pt}

Explain why every autonomous equaiton is separable. A non-autonomous equation could be separable or not. For a linear equation we usually say LTI (\textbf{linear time-invariant}) when it is autonomous: coefficients are constant, not varying with \(t\).}

Every autonomous equation is separable by writing
\[
	\int \frac{dy}{f \!\left( y \right) } = \int \, dt
\]

% QUESTION 21
\qs{1.8.21}{\(my'' + ky = 0\) is a highly important LTI equation. Two solutions are \(\cos \omega t\) and \(\sin \omega t\) when \(\omega^{2} = k/m\). Solve differently by reducing to a first order equation for \(y' = dy/dt = v\) with \(y'' = v dv/dy\) as above:

\[
	mv \frac{d v}{d y} + ky = 0 \quad \text{integrates to} \quad \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} + \frac{1}{2}k y^{2} = \text{constant } E
\]
For a mass on a spring, kinetic energy \(\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\) plus potential energy \(\frac{1}{2} ky^{2}\) is a constant energy \(E\). What is \(E\) when \(y  = \cos \omega t\)? What integral solves the separable \(m \!\left( y' \right)^{2} = 2E - ky^{2}\)? I would not solve the linear oscillation equation this way.}

We solve as follows:

\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies && m\int^{v \!\left( y \right) }_{v \!\left( 0 \right) } v \, dv & = -k \int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) }  y \, dy   \\
	\implies && \frac{1}{2}mv \!\left( y \right) ^{2} - \frac{1}{2}mv \!\left( 0 \right)^{2} & = -\frac{1}{2}ky \!\left( t \right) ^{2} + \frac{1}{2}k y \!\left( 0 \right)^{2} \\
	\implies && \frac{1}{2} mv \!\left( y \right)^{2} + \frac{1}{2} k y \!\left( t \right)^{2} & = \frac{1}{2}m v \!\left( 0 \right)^{2} + \frac{1}{2} k y \!\left( 0 \right)^{2} = E
\end{alignat*}

Let \(y \!\left( t \right) = \cos \omega t\). Since \(v = y' = -\omega \sin \omega t\), we have
\[
	E = \frac{1}{2}m \omega^{2} \sin^{2} \omega t + \frac{1}{2} k \cos^{2} \omega t = \frac{1}{2} k \sin^{2} \omega t + \frac{1}{2} k \cos^{2} \omega t = k
\]
The separable \(m \!\left( y' \right)^{2} = 2E - ky^{2}\) is solved by
\[
	\int \sqrt{\frac{m}{2E - ky^{2}}} \, dy = t
\]
Which is not a pleasant integral to evaluate.

% QUESTION 22
\qs{1.8.22}{\(my'' + k \sin y = 0\) is the \textit{nonlinear} oscillation equation: not so simple. Reduce to a first order equation as in Problem 21:
\[
	mv \frac{d v}{d y} + k \sin y = 0 \quad \text{integrates to} \quad \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - k \cos y = \text{constant } E.
\]
With \(v = dy/dt\) what impossible integral is needed for this first order separable equation? Actually that integral gives the period of a nonlinear pendulum -- this integral is extremely important and well studied even if impossible.}

We solve the equation as follows:

\begin{alignat*}{3}
	\implies && m \int^{v \!\left( y \right) }_{v \!\left( 0 \right) } v \, dv   & = -k \int^{y \!\left( t \right) }_{y \!\left( 0 \right) } \sin y \, dy  \\
	\implies && \frac{1}{2}m v \!\left( y \right)^{2} - \frac{1}{2}m v \!\left( 0 \right)^{2} & = k \cos y \!\left( t \right) - k \cos y \!\left( 0 \right)  \\
	\implies && \frac{1}{2}m v \!\left( y \right)^{2} - k \cos y \!\left( t \right) & = \frac{1}{2}m v \!\left( 0 \right)^{2} - k \cos y \!\left( 0 \right) = E 
\end{alignat*}

Knowing that \(v = dy/dt\), if we were to write a separable equation in terms of \(y\) and \(t\), we would have
\[
	\int \sqrt{\frac{m}{2E - 2k \cos y}} \, dy = t
\]
which is an unpleasantly impossible integral!
